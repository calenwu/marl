# MARL with Local Observation and Communication
In this repository serves for the implementation for the algorithms, environments and experiments of the MARL with Local Observation & Communication Project for the Foundations of Reinforcement Learning Lecture.
In the following we outline the location of the implementations for clarity:
* Cat & Mouse environment: marl_gym
* PPO: catmouse_experiments/ (Cat & Mouse), ppo_algorithm (Lumberjacks)
* IPPO: ippo_algorithm/ (Both environments)
* MAPPO: mappo_algorithm/ (Both environments
* IPPO with Belief: ippo_algorithm_belief_catmouse/ (Cat & Mouse), ippo_algorithm_belief_lumberjack/ (Lumberjacks)
* Further Research: unused/
